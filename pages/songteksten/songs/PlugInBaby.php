		<h1>Muse - Plug in baby</h1>
		<p> 
			I've exposed your lies
			Baby
			The underneath's no big surprise
			Now it's time for changing
			And cleansing everything to forget your love
		</p> 
		<p> 
			My plug in baby
			Crucifies my enemies
			When I'm tired of giving
			My plug in baby
			In unbroken virgin realities
			Is tired of living
		</p> 
		<p> 
			Don't confuse
			Baby your gonna lose
			Your own game
			Change me
			Replace the envying
			To forget your love
		</p> 
		<p> 
			My plug in baby
			Crucifies my enemies
			When I'm tired of giving
			My plug in baby
			In unbroken virgin realities
			Is tired of living
		</p> 
		<p> 
			And I've seen your loving
			Mine is gone
		</p> 
		<p> 
			And I've been in trouble
			wooaahhhh
