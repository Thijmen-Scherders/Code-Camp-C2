		<h1>Muse - Madness</h1>
		<p> 
            I, I can't get these memories out of my mind
            And some kind of madness has started to evolve
            I, I tried so hard to let you go
            But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah
		</p> 
		<p> 
            I have finally seen the light
            And I have finally realized
            What you mean
            Oh oh oh
		</p> 
		<p> 
            And now, I need to know is this real love
            Or is it just madness keeping us afloat?
            And when I look back at all the crazy fights we had
            Like some kind of madness
            Was taking control
            Yeah
		</p> 
		<p> 
            And now I have finally seen the light
            And I have finally realized
            What you need
            Mm
		</p> 
		<p> 
            But now I have finally seen the end (finally seen the end)
            And I'm not expecting you to care (expecting you to care)
            That I have finally seen the light (finally seen the light)
            I have finally realized (realized)
            I need to love
            I need to love
		</p> 
		<p> 
            Come to me
            Trust in a dream
            Come on and rescue me
            Yes I know, I can be wrong
            And maybe I'm too headstrong
            Our love is
            Madness
