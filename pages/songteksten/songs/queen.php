		<h1>Bohemian Rhapsody </h1>
		<p> 
			
            Is this the real life?
            Is this just fantasy?
            Caught in a landslide
            No escape from reality
		</p> 
		<p> 
            Open your eyes
            Look up to the skies and see
            I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
            Because I'm easy come, easy go
            Little high, little low
            Any way the wind blows
            Doesn't really matter to me, to me
		</p> 
		<p> 
            Mama, just killed a man
            Put a gun against his head
            Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
            Mama, life had just begun
            But now I've gone and thrown it all away
		</p> 
		<p> 
            Mama, ooh
            Didn't mean to make you cry
            If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
            Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
		</p> 
		<p> 
            Too late, my time has come
            Sends shivers down my spine
            Body's aching all the time
            Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
            Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
		</p> 
		<p> 
            Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
            I don't want to die
            I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
		</p>

        <p>
            I see a little silhouetto of a man
            Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
            Thunderbolt and lightning very, very frightening me
            Galileo) Galileo
            (Galileo) Galileo
            Galileo Figaro
            Magnifico-o-o-o-o
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
            He's just a poor boy from a poor family
            Spare him his life from this monstrosity
        </p>

        <p>
            Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
            Bismillah! No, we will not let you go (Let him go!)
            Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let him go!)
            Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let me go!)
            Will not let you go (Let me go!)
            Never let you go (Never, never, never, never let me go)
            Oh oh oh oh
            No, no, no, no, no, no, no
            Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go)
            Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me
        </p>

        <p>
            So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
            So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
            Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
            Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
        </p>

        <p>
            Ooooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
            Nothing really matters
            Anyone can see
            Nothing really matters
            Nothing really matters to me
            Any way the wind blows...
