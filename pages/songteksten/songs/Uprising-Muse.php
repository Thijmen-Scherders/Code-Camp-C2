		<h1>Muse - Uprising</h1>
		<p> 
            Paranoia is in bloom
            The PR transmissions will resume
            They'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down
            And hope that we will never see the truth around
            (So come on)
		</p> 
		<p> 
            Another promise, another scene
            Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
            And all the green belts wrapped around our minds
            And endless red tape to keep the truth confined
            (So come on)
		</p> 
		<p> 
            They will not force us
            They will stop degrading us
            They will not control us
            We will be victorious
            (So come on)
		</p> 
		<p> 
            Interchanging mind control
            Come, let the revolution take its toll
            If you could flick the switch and open your third eye
            You'd see that we should never be afraid to die
            (So come on)
		</p> 
		<p> 
            Rise up and take the power back
            It's time the fat cats had a heart attack
            You know that their time's coming to an end
            We have to unify and watch our flag ascend
            (So come on)
		</p> 
		<p> 
            They will not force us
            They will stop degrading us
            They will not control us
            We will be victorious
            (So come on)
		</p>
        <p>
            They will not force us
            They will stop degrading us
            They will not control us
            We will be victorious
            (So come on)
        </p>
