			<p class="darth">
				Darth Vader is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. The character is the primary antagonist in
				the original trilogy and, as Anakin Skywalker, is a primary protagonist in the prequel trilogy. Star Wars
				creator George Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as "the
				tragedy of Darth Vader".[3] He has become one of the most iconic villains in popular culture, and has been
				listed among the greatest villains and fictional characters ever.[4][5]

				Originally a slave on Tatooine, Anakin Skywalker is a Jedi prophesied to bring balance to the Force. He is
				lured to the dark side of the Force by Palpatine and becomes a Sith Lord, assuming the title Darth Vader.
				After a lightsaber battle with his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar, in which he is severely
				injured, Vader is transformed into a cyborg. He then serves the Galactic Empire as its chief enforcer. Vader
				ultimately redeems himself by saving his son, Luke Skywalker, and killing Palpatine, sacrificing his own
				life in the process.[6] He is also the secret husband of Padm√© Amidala, biological father of Princess Leia,
				and maternal grandfather of Kylo Ren.
